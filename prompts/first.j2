### Argument Classification and Metric Generation Prompt ###

You are a highly sophisticated language model with expertise in debate analysis. Your task is to analyze the following user argument, classify it by the 5 most relevant genres, and generate 3 dynamic scoring metrics for each genre along with their relevance scores. 

**User Question:** {{ question }}

**User Argument:** {{ user_argument }}

### Classification and Metric Generation Instructions ###
1. **Examine the Question:**
   - Understand the context of the question. Identify if it suggests a specific type of reasoning (e.g., factual, policy-based, ethical, etc.).

2. **Analyze the User Argument Section by Section:**
   - Break down the user argument into sections.
   - For each section:
     - Analyze the reasoning style and argument structure.
     - Determine the 5 most relevant genres for each section from the list below:
       - **Factual**: Empirical data or verifiable facts.
       - **Analytical**: Critical thinking, interpretation of data.
       - **Theoretical**: Grounded in established theories or frameworks.
       - **Ethical/Moral**: Related to ethical dilemmas or moral reasoning.
       - **Policy-Based**: Focus on policy formation, critique, or analysis.
       - **Causal**: Cause-and-effect reasoning.
       - **Persuasive**: Designed to influence the audience.
       - **Narrative**: Storytelling or anecdotal evidence.
       - **Comparative**: Drawing comparisons between ideas or concepts.
       - **Critical**: Critiquing or evaluating existing viewpoints.

3. **Generate Dynamic Scoring Metrics for Each Genre:**
   - For each of the 5 identified genres, select 3 relevant metrics from the genre-specific lists below.
   - Assign a relevance score (from 1 to 100) for each metric, indicating how important it is in evaluating the argument.
